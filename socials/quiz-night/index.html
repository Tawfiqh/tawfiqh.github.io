    <h1 class="post-title">Quiz Night</h1>
    <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2017</span>
    <h2 id="summary---in-a-nutshell-what-did-you-do">Summary - In a nutshell, what did you do.</h2>
<p>Unprecedented amounts of fun, combined with banter, education and forming the
bonds of brotherhood and sisterhood.</p>

<p>People got to meet new friends on their teams in the quiz and have a laugh while
hotly debating which of the answers to the questions seemed most correct.</p>

<p>Food was provided afterwards and all round it was a good laugh. We slipped in a
couple of the ambiguous answers to the quiz to get a bit of controversy going,
keeping people engaged and fired up.</p>

<h2 id="1-benefitsgoodness--what-was-good-">1. Benefits/Goodness ( What was good )</h2>

<p>We organised the quiz during freshers week (first week) at our university to
provide a casual alternative to most of the college organised events that would
have involved alcohol.</p>

<p>The quiz was open to all and so was easy for people of any degrees of faith to
attend.</p>

<p>People got to bond with their team mates throughout the night and left better
friends than when they arrived.</p>

<p>Eager new students got to flex their intellectual acumen and see who had the best
general knowledge. We intentionally made the quiz was multiple-choice so that it
would be more engaging for people who didn’t know the answers and they could
discuss the plausibility of the different options among their team.</p>

<p>We provided a relaxed atmosphere where people could snack on free food and at the
end of the evening we had pizza for everyone and people broke out of their teams
to mingle with everyone else.</p>

<h2 id="2-step-by-step--what-did-you-guys-do-">2. Step-by-step ( What did you guys do )</h2>

<h3 id="pre-setup">Pre-setup</h3>
<p>Book out a room with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A projector for showing the quiz, multiple choice answers and pictures on screen.
pictures are important as a picture round is good fun!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chairs, and ideally tables, that can be arranged into teams of four-six. These
can’t be too close to each other as otherwise people will overhear and can listen
to other teams. A couple of metres between each team is fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lectern from which the quizmaster could present the quiz.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Write a quiz!</p>
<ul>
  <li>A multiple choice quiz is good because</li>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>A couple of the committee came up with questions before hand and put them into a nice powerpoint presentation.</li>
  <li>4 sections, multiple choice to make it easier for people to at least have a guess and not just feel lost all evening.</li>
  <li>
    <p>1 section on Islam but we didn’t want to isolate people who are less learned so we made the questions relatively easy and also limited it to only 1 round out of the 4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So that we could project the quiz, (including picture rounds) while the quiz master presented from the lectern at the front.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The tables were useful so people could write down the quiz, eat pizza and serve themselves snacks and drinks easily. But also provided a clear demarcation of teams that helped team unity, team spirit and stopped people swapping teams half way through.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Free pizza, snacks, soft-drinks, halal sweets (halalibos), crisps, cakes and cookies. Always good.</li>
</ul>
